Greetings Commander. I'll be your Mission Specialist for the Nostos project. We have ten years to turn this alien planet into a home in time for the settler ship to arrive.

I have nearly forty years of terrestrial operations experience. I will advise you on major events that threaten the success of this project.

Completing this project will be no easy task. You will have to invest our limited resources into building the most useful structures for our colony. Everything is a risk.

Now enough dawdling. We have wasted enough time already, and this placewon't terraform itself. Just remember, the fate of this planet, of all mankind, is in your hands.
