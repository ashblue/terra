To be honest, I thought I would die on this rock. Sometimes it really felt like this planet was trying to kill us. At my age, I wouldn't have minded.

But somehow, you made the right choices at the right time, and certainly luck had something to do with it. You've turned this barren landscape into healthy planet. A home.

I don't say this often, so believe me when I say this. I'm proud of you commander. You brought mankind's exodus to an end. Mark my words. You will be remembered.
